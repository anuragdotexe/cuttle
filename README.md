## 🛠️ Building Cuttle: Tech Behind the Game  

The magic that powers the **Cuttle web app** lies in a stack of modern technologies. Here’s a quick peek into how we’ve built this experience:

- **Front-end (Client):** The user interface is a sleek **Single Page Application (SPA)** crafted with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and styled using the versatile **Vuetify framework**.  
- **Back-end (Server):** The brain of the game lives on the server, a robust **Node.js** app structured with [Sails.js](https://sailsjs.com/get-started), which keeps everything running smoothly.
- **Testing:** We believe in delivering a bug-free experience, so we test the entire system end-to-end with the help of **[Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/)**.

If you're interested in diving deeper into how it all fits together or contributing to the code, you’ll find the [Setup & Development Guide](./docs/setup-development.md) quite handy!
